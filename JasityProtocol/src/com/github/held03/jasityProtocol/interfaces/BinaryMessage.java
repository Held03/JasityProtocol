/**
 * Self coding and decoding message.
 * <p>
 * This represents a message as described in {@link Message}, but this messages
 * will have a facility to code and decode them self to and from binary forms.
 * <p>
 * Notice that such a message need to have at least an empty constructor, this
 * means that the constructor has no arguments. For safety it is recommend to
 * declare it explicit. If not the reassembling will fail.
 * <p>
 * It is recommend that they can at least decode messages of old implementation
 * and/or ignore new/unknown arguments.
 * <p>
 * So this can be very complex but offers the ability to code a message as good
 * as possible and save traffic.
 * <p>
 * If used the {@link Connection} will call the {@link #codeMessage()} method on
 * the object to send and gets the {@link ByteBuffer} to send. The returned
 * {@link ByteBuffer} can have any length, if it is too long the
 * {@link Connection} will break it into smaller packages, send them separately
 * and finally reassemble them on the receiving side.
 * <p>
 * If received a empty instance will be created an the
 * {@link #decodeMessage(ByteBuffer)} method on the empty instance will be
 * called. That method has to read and set up all the fields from the given and
 * reassembled {@link ByteBuffer}.
