/**
 * The standard interfaces.
 * <p>
 * These interfaces represent the core of this library.
 * They are the thing to use.
 * <p>
 * This defines a interface to be used either to implement a
 * connection/transport system, and on the other side to implement a working
 * implementation.
 * <p>
 * The working implementation creates on the server-side a 
 * {@link com.github.held03.jasityProtocol.interfaces.Server} instance or
 * implement it. For the server it needs a
 * {@link com.github.held03.jasityProtocol.interfaces.ClientListener}
 * implementation.
 * <br>
 * On client-side the working implementation need a
 * {@link com.github.held03.jasityProtocol.interfaces.Client} instance or
 * implementation and for that in needs to implement a
 * {@link com.github.held03.jasityProtocol.interfaces.ServerListener}.
 * <br>
 * Both can have some listeners defined with
 * {@link com.github.held03.jasityProtocol.interfaces.JPListener} and
 * registered either on a
 * {@link com.github.held03.jasityProtocol.interfaces.Connection} or like
 * recommended on a
 * {@link com.github.held03.jasityProtocol.interfaces.NodeConnection}. The can
 * be retrieved from the server or client instances.
 * <br>
 * Additional both need to implement some
 * {@link com.github.held03.jasityProtocol.interfaces.Message}s or use some
 * predefined. All the used messages must be available on both sides client
 * and server. 
 * <p>
 * Such a implementation should be independent from the underlying transport
 * system. But it can be explicitly chosen by using a specific factory or by
 * changing the default factories to a specific.
 * <p>
 * To implement a transport system it needs to implement a
 * {@link com.github.held03.jasityProtocol.interfaces.Connection} and setup a
 * specific factory for it. The connection must handle at least all defined
 * message types within this package. If necessary also a
 * {@link com.github.held03.jasityProtocol.interfaces.Server} and
 * {@link com.github.held03.jasityProtocol.interfaces.Client} can be
 * implemented.
