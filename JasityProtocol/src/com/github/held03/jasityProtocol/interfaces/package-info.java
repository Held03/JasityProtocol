/**
 * The standard interfaces.
 * <p>
 * These interfaces represent the core of this library.
 * They are the thing to use.
 * <p>
 * For a working usage it needs to implement the {@link com.github.held03.jasityProtocol.interfaces.ClientListener},
 * {@link com.github.held03.jasityProtocol.interfaces.ServerListener} and some {@link com.github.held03.jasityProtocol.interfaces.Message}s.
 * Additional it is possible to use the {@link com.github.held03.jasityProtocol.interfaces.JPListener} annotation to
 * create message listeners.
 * <p>
 * The other interfaces represents the server client system which is implemented by this library,
 * but are still implementable for expansion.
