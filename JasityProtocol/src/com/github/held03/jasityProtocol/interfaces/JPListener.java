/**
 * Message listener method.
 * <p>
 * This annotation is for marking methods which serves as message listener.
 * <p>
 * The message argument of the method defines the type of message which will be
 * handled by this listener. It is defined either as a class or a interface. All
 * messages which implements or extends this will be received, as well as the
 * class self. <br>
 * If a method uses {@link Message} as argument will receive every message. <br>
 * Anyway the class of this message argument must implement or extend the
 * {@link Message} interface.
 * <p>
 * The listener method needs specific arguments. There are two possible
 * configurations: * first one argument, the message argument. * second two
 * arguments, 1. the message argument, 2. a {@link NodeConnection}
 * <p>
 * Important such a method must return a boolean value. That indicate if the
 * message was consumed. That means if a early listener returns
 * <code>true</code> the message will be NOT future forward to the other
 * listeners. Therefore is also like a cancel value. <br>
 * The default return value of such a method is <code>false</code>.
 * <p>
 * It is allowed that a class/object has multiple and different such listeners.
 * They are registered at once if the object is registered. And separately
 * invoked as they are defined.
