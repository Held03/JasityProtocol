	 * it sends the <code>Send</code> command and the receiver answers with the
	 * <code>Complete</code> command.
	 * <p>

	 * how, any one writes <code>Error</code>. The other node can answer even
	 * with <code>Error</code>, it like the <code>Bye</code> command of the
	 * {@link #BLOCK_HELLO} block. If the receivers thinks the sending of
	 * message hangs up, can send the <code>WhatsUp</code> command. The sender
	 * can answer differently, either if the transmission was broken it answers
	 * <code>Error</code>, if there is still some thing to send it answers
	 * <code>Pending</code> also if it is still sending blocks. If the
	 * transmission was successful it answers <code>Send</code> and the receiver
