/**
 * Message meta data block.
 * <p>
 * A block for general messages control.
 * 
 * <pre>
 * Structure:
 * 
 * - byte: type:
 *          0: New       - start new message
 *          1: Unknown   - received block about a unknown message
 *          2: Sent      - completely sent a message
 *          3: Complete  - successfully received message
 *          4: ErrorSend - message sending fail
 *          5: WhatsUp   - too long no request
 *          6: Pending   - message is waiting in the queue
 *          7: ErrorRece - message receiving fail
 * - long: message ID
 * - int: message size or zero (only parsed on NEW)
 * </pre>
 * 
 * The sender first sends the <code>New</code> command with the related ID and a
 * CRC checksum. Afterwards the sender sends all the blocks by
 * {@link #BLOCK_MESSAGE_BLOCK}. If the receiver receives a
 * {@link #BLOCK_MESSAGE_BLOCK} without knowing the message ID, is sends an
 * <code>Unknown</code> command and the sender answers with the <code>New</code>
 * command again exactly like above. If the sender sent all block and received
 * all {@link #BLOCK_MESSAGE_BLOCK_FEEDBACK}s about them, it sends the
 * <code>Send</code> command and the receiver answers with the
 * <code>Complete</code> command.
 * <p>
 * If any when an deep error occurs or the transmission was canceled any how,
 * any one writes <code>ErrorSend</code> or <code>ErrorRece</code>. The other
 * node can answer even with <code>ErrorRece</code> or <code>ErrorSend</code>,
 * it is like the <code>Bye</code> command of the {@link #BLOCK_HELLO} block for
 * a message. If the receivers thinks the sending of message hangs up, can send
 * the <code>WhatsUp</code> command. The sender can answer differently, either
 * if the transmission was broken it answers <code>ErrorSend</code>, if there is
 * still some thing to send it answers <code>Pending</code> also if it is still
 * sending blocks. If the transmission was successful it answers
 * <code>Send</code> and the receiver has to answer like above.
 * <p>
 * <code>ErrorSend</code> is always send by the sender. <code>ErrorRece</code>
 * is always send by the receiver. This is important to distinguish if a local
 * or a remote message is canceled.
