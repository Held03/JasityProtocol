See the [main folder](https://github.com/Held03/JasityProtocol/tree/master/JasityProtocol) for more inforations.

### Getting source

We use the eclipse IDE (http://eclipse.org/)
Therefore, we recommend to use it.

#### Eclipse guide

Install a git extension to eclipse, if not already done, or use the console.

Anyway clone the repository with git. With the extension choose the 'clone a repository' button of the repository view.
Use the URL from the project page on github:

    https://github.com/Held03/JasityProtocol.git

If you have added the project to a git extension of eclipse right click it and choose 'import projects...'.
Follow the dialogue and finally you have the JasityProtocol added to your eclipse IDE.

If you don't have such a extension use a command and type the following or download as ZIP:

    git clone https://github.com/Held03/JasityProtocol.git
  
then use in eclipse the import tool and choose 'Existing Project into Workspace'
or if you downloaded as ZIP 'Archive File'.
Go on in the dialogue and finally you have the JasityProtocol added to your eclipse IDE.

If you want to use in your project right click you project in overview and choose 'Properties',
there choose 'Java Build Path' and the tab 'Projects'.
Here you can 'Add..' the JasityProtocol and can use it in your project.

#### No-Eclipse guide
